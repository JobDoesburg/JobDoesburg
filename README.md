### Hi there 👋

- 🔐 I'm currently a Master's student in [Cyber Security](https://true-security.nl) at the [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl).
- 🧠 Though specialized in cyber security, I consider one of my strength to be an all-round computing scientist with knowledge of many fields.
- 🤖 I have a minor in Artificial Intelligence.
- 📜 I have special interest in information security legislation and digital security in practice.
- 👨‍💻 I'm trying to improve my skills on software development project managment 
- 🗳️ In my [Bachelor thesis](https://www.cs.ru.nl/bachelors-theses/2020/Job_Doesburg___4809327___Using_IRMA_for_small_scale_digital_elections.pdf), I conducted research on how the attribute-based credential system [IRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation) can be used for small-scale digital elections. Based on this, [IRMA-vote](https://ihub.ru.nl/project/irma-vote.page) is developed.
- 🐍 I mainly identify as a Python developer (though I'm terrified of snakes) and I'm currently working on a lot of Django projects.
- 👨‍🏫 I work as a student assistant, teaching some (bachelor) courses at my university
- 🖼️ I do a lot of work as graphic designer
- 🍎 I have a MacBook (and an iPhone) (and an Apple Watch) (yes, I'm a Apple user)
- 🏋️ I like to spend time in the gym (and occasionally even go for a run).
- 🏉 I recently started playing rugby.
- 🌐 I still haven't made a personal portfolio website...
