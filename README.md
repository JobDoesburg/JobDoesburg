### Hi there 👋

- 🔐 I'm currently a PhD candidate at the [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl), working at the [Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)](https://www.ru.nl/en/institute-for-computing-and-information-sciences)] for the [Department of Software Science (SwS)](https://sws.cs.ru.nl).
- 🤖 I'm working for the [National Education Lab AI (NOLAI)](https://nolai.nl) in the Sustainable Data focus area, researching how to responsible process data in the context of AI and education. 
- 🧠 Though specialized in cyber security, I consider one of my strength to be an **all-round** computing scientist with knowledge of many fields.
- 🔒 I wrote my [Master thesis](https://jobdoesburg.nl/docs/Measures_against_over_asking_in_SSI_and_the_Yivi_ecosystem.pdf) at [iHub](https://ihub.ru.nl), researching measures against over-asking in SSI wallets (specifically the [Yivi ecosystem](https://www.yivi.app)).
- 🪪 During my [Research Internship](https://demo.rde.filesenderbeta.surf.nl/Remote_Document_Encryption_in_SURFfilesender.pdf), I developed a prototype for [Remote Document Encryption](http://www.cs.ru.nl/E.Verheul/papers/SFS2020/RDE-SFS%200.63.pdf) in the [FileSender](https://filesender.org) project, which you can try out [here](https://demo.rde.filesenderbeta.surf.nl).
- 🗳️ In my [Bachelor thesis](https://jobdoesburg.nl/docs/Using_IRMA_for_small_scale_digital_elections.pdf), I conducted research on how the attribute-based credential system [IRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation) can be used for small-scale digital elections. Based on this, [IRMA-vote](https://ihub.ru.nl/project/2024-03-13-irma-vote/) is developed.
- 🖼️ I have some freelance experience as **graphic designer**.
- 🏋️ I like to spend time in the gym (and occasionally even go for a run).
- 🏉 I play rugby.
