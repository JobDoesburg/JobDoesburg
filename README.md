### Hi there, I'm Job 👋

- 🎓 I'm a PhD candidate at the [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl), working at the [Institute for Computing and Information Sciences (iCIS)](https://www.ru.nl/en/institute-for-computing-and-information-sciences)] for the [Department of Software Science (SwS)](https://sws.cs.ru.nl).
- 🤖 I'm working for the [National Education Lab AI (NOLAI)](https://nolai.nl) in the **Sustainable Data** focus area, researching how to responsibly process data, specifically in the context of AI and education. 
- 🧠 Though specialized in **privacy and security**, I consider one of my strengths to be a **practical, all-round** computer scientist with knowledge of many fields.
- 👨‍💻️ I like to combine academic research with some actual **software engineering**.
- 💻 Apart from my PhD, I maintain some other (mostly open-source) software projects.

Projects:
- 🎭 I'm currently working on end-to-end encrypted pseudonymization technologies and how this can be generically used to improve privacy in complex data processing systems.
- 🪪 I wrote my [Master thesis](https://jobdoesburg.nl/docs/Measures_against_over_asking_in_SSI_and_the_Yivi_ecosystem.pdf) at [iHub](https://ihub.ru.nl), researching measures against over-asking in SSI wallets (specifically the [Yivi ecosystem](https://www.yivi.app)).
- 🔐 During my [Research Internship](http://localhost:63343/JobDoesburg/docs/Remote_Document_Encryption_in_SURFfilesender.pdf) at [SURF](https://www.surf.nl), I developed a proof-of-concept for [Remote Document Encryption](http://www.cs.ru.nl/E.Verheul/papers/SFS2020/RDE-SFS%200.63.pdf) in the [FileSender](https://filesender.org) project.
- 🗳️ In my [Bachelor thesis](https://jobdoesburg.nl/docs/Using_IRMA_for_small_scale_digital_elections.pdf), I conducted research on how the attribute-based credential system [IRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation) can be used for small-scale digital elections. Based on this, the [IRMA-vote](https://ihub.ru.nl/project/2024-03-13-irma-vote/) proof-of-concept was developed.

Hobbies:
- 🏉 I play rugby at [NSRV Obelix](https://www.nsrv-obelix.nl) in Nijmegen.
- 🏋️ I like to spend time in the gym (and occasionally even go for a run).
- 🖼️ I have some freelance experience as **graphic designer**.
