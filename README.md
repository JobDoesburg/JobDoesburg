### Hi there 👋

- 🔐 I'm currently a Master's student in **[Cyber Security](https://true-security.nl)** at the [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl).
- 🧠 Though specialized in cyber security, I consider one of my strength to be an **all-round** computing scientist with knowledge of many fields.
- 🔒 Currently, I'm working on my master thesis at [iHub](https://ihub.ru.nl), researching how to securely implement a DNA medication profile in [IRMA](https://irma.app) and how access to such highly sensitive credentials can be restricted. 
- 🪪 During my [Research Internship](https://demo.rde.filesenderbeta.surf.nl/Remote_Document_Encryption_in_SURFfilesender.pdf), I developed a prototype for [Remote Document Encryption](http://www.cs.ru.nl/E.Verheul/papers/SFS2020/RDE-SFS%200.63.pdf) in the [FileSender](https://filesender.org) project, which you can try out [here](https://demo.rde.filesenderbeta.surf.nl).
- 🗳️ In my [Bachelor thesis](https://www.cs.ru.nl/bachelors-theses/2020/Job_Doesburg___4809327___Using_IRMA_for_small_scale_digital_elections.pdf), I conducted research on how the attribute-based credential system [IRMA](https://privacybydesign.foundation) can be used for small-scale digital elections. Based on this, [IRMA-vote](https://ihub.ru.nl/project/irma-vote.page) is developed.
- 🤖 I have a minor in Artificial Intelligence.
- 📜 I have special interest in **information security legislation** and **digital security in practice**.
- 👨‍💻 I'm trying to improve my skills on software development project managment.
- 🐍 I mainly identify as a **Python developer** (though I'm terrified of snakes) and I'm currently working on a lot of **Django projects**.
- 🏗 I consider myself to be a **software architect**.
- 👨‍🏫 I work as a student assistant, teaching some (bachelor) courses at my university.
- 🖼️ I do a lot of work as **graphic designer**.
- 🍎 I have a MacBook (and an iPhone) (and an Apple Watch) (yes, I'm a Apple user).
